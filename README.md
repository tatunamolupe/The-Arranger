# The-Arranger
The Arranger A nice implementation of the magic squares game where the objective is to arrange the numbers in order. Multiple levels, timer and counter included. Warning: The game is very addictive! (Internet Explorer, FireFox only).

<li>Choose a Level (3 to 10).</li>



<li>The game board has blocks with numbers in it. Also there is a single "hole" that can be used for moving the blocks.</li>



<li>The objective of the game is to order the numbers using the "hole" for temporary movement.</li>



<li>Press the "Start Game" button. The timer would be started.</li>



<li>Move blocks in a row by clicking on them. A block can be moved only if it is in the same row or column as the "hole". Make a guess by typing in a number in the box provided.</li>



<li>You can move multiple blocks (in the same row or column as the "hole") by clicking the farthest block that you need to be moved.</li>



</ol>



Order all the numbers in the shortest time possible with a minimum number of moves...
